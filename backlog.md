# Feature Justification & Vision

## Why do clients want our features?

Clients (students/job seekers) want our features because preparing for interviews can be stressful, confusing, and time-consuming. They want quick, personalized tools that help them practice and improve, without needing to book appointments or rely on others. Our app gives them on-demand tools to improve their resume, simulate interviews, and track progress — all in one place.

## What is the core concept (conceptual integrity) of our features?

All our features focus on **simplicity**, **smart feedback**, and **self-guided prep**. The goal is to make the user feel like they’re getting smarter and more prepared with every click. We use clean UI, meaningful feedback, and intuitive workflows — so students can focus on improving, not figuring out how to use the app.

## Sales Pitch

**JobPrep+** is your smart personal coach for interview prep. With instant resume analysis, mock interviews, and personalized feedback — it turns stress into confidence. No more guesswork, just real growth with every session.
