## Project Title
**Inventory Manager**

## Slogan
“Simple, Fast, and Reliable Inventory Tracking.”

## Goal
Build a user-friendly inventory management system using Node.js and MongoDB that allows authorized users to efficiently manage stock, track inventory in real-time, and receive smart alerts for low-stock items.

## Features

### Add Items
Authorized users can create new inventory entries with item name, quantity, price, and category.

### View Stock & Search
Users can view all items with real-time stock levels and search by item name or category.

### Update & Manage Inventory
Users can increment/decrement item quantities, remove discontinued items, and track inventory adjustments.

### Low Stock Notifications
The system flags items that are below a certain threshold and notifies the user for restocking.
